@startuml
title Example

' https://plantuml.com/class-diagram
$Class01 "1" *-- "many" Class02 : contains
Class03 o-- Class04 : aggregation
Class05 --> "1" Class060
Class06 -> Class060 : pointing right

#+end_src
***** Solution
Add PlantUML to the load path:

#+begin_example elisp
(setq org-plantuml-jar-path (expand-file-name "/root/plantuml.jar"))
(add-to-list 'org-src-lang-modes '("plantuml" . plantuml))
(org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages '((plantuml . t)))
#+end_example

Fixed in [[orgit-rev:.::621794b][621794b master Generate PlantUML]].
